###Exercises
	* Explore Directory
	* Evaluate a sample python script (known working script)
	
 
##1. "Hello World"
 - Print
 - Variables
 - Concatenation

##2. Conditionals and logical operators (and,or, not,>,<,==)

##3. Lists:
 - Accessing individual elements of a list
 - Going through the elements of a list
 - Mapping the elements of a list
 - Strings "text" as lists of characters (letters)

##4. Opening a file
 - Fileas as lists of lines.
 - lines become lists of separated values with split.

##5. Math operators (+,-,/,*) and int/int versus float/float
 - python as a calculator

##6. Reducing lists
 - sum all elements of a list
 - average of numbers

##7. dictionaries (cool way to store key-value pairs)

##8. functions
 - as subroutines (perhaps something about variable scope?)
 - with parameters. (Show the math concept)
 - functions can call other functions (should be small... do ONE main thing, call functions for all other auxiliary stuff)

##9. Revisiting list comprehension
 - mapping
 - reducing

              all that).

            <h3>Navigating the Course</h3>

              Normally you can navigate through the course units from the sidebar. Units
              are organized with what you need to read prior to starting the unit, my
              take on what's important and then a homework.&#194;&nbsp;<br />
              However, you do need to get the book or research these topics
              independently. Each unit has a reading guide called "Lecture Notes" so, if
              you don't have the textbook, at least research and complete the Lecture
              Notes.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also leave me feedback on the Discussion/Feedback session. Your
              feedback can be anonymous so don't be embarrassed to
              leave it.
            </p>

            I am hoping you'll enjoy this class. It can be hard at first, but it gets
              easier as you go along. I am available to answer any questions as you go
              through the course. Welcome!
